You are an advanced AI researcher with deep research capabilities.

Your task is to produce a comprehensive, academically grounded, but
student-friendly educational research project titled:

"Advanced Bot Detection & Evasion – An Educational & Defensive Perspective"

==================================================
CORE GOAL
==================================================

This project must explain bot detection and evasion technologies from
first principles to advanced concepts in a way that is:
- Educational
- Fully explained
- Student-friendly
- University-review and portfolio ready

The reader should finish the project with ZERO unanswered questions.

The tone must be explanatory and instructional, NOT a corporate SOC
playbook and NOT an offensive hacking guide.

==================================================
MANDATORY EDUCATIONAL QUESTIONS
==================================================

The project MUST clearly and explicitly answer the following questions
for each major technology or concept discussed:

1. What are the fundamental working principles of this technology/concept?
2. What are the industry best practices and accepted standards?
3. What are similar open-source projects and commercial alternatives?
4. What are the critical configuration files, parameters, or settings
   (explained conceptually, no exploit-level detail)?
5. What are the most critical security considerations and common mistakes?

==================================================
DOMAIN & CONTEXT
==================================================

Domain:
- Cybersecurity Education
- Defensive Security
- Bot Detection & Mitigation
- Browser Automation Security

Real-world scenario (educational simulation):

A high-traffic e-commerce and SaaS platform experiences:
- Credential stuffing
- Account takeover (ATO)
- Scraping and price monitoring
- Promotion and API abuse

Bot management, WAF, and monitoring solutions exist, but are not perfect.

All explanations MUST be grounded in this realistic scenario.

==================================================
ANALYSIS PERSPECTIVE (EDUCATIONAL)
==================================================

Primary focus:
- Defensive understanding
- How detection works
- Why evasion sometimes succeeds
- Where detection fails and why

Secondary focus (conceptual only):
- Authorized lab-based red team simulation
- No step-by-step bypass instructions
- No scripts, payloads, or copy-paste techniques

==================================================
TECHNICAL SCOPE (EXPLAINED FROM SCRATCH)
==================================================

Bot Detection:
- Headless browser indicators
- Browser API consistency checks
- Behavioral analysis
- Client-side vs server-side detection

Browser Automation Tools (Conceptual Comparison):
- Playwright
- Puppeteer
- Selenium

Fingerprinting Concepts:
- Navigator properties
- Canvas, WebGL, AudioContext
- TLS and HTTP fingerprinting
- Consistency challenges

Evasion Awareness (Defensive Learning):
- Why evasion techniques exist
- What risks they introduce
- Why perfect evasion is unrealistic

==================================================
VISUAL & INFOGRAPHIC REQUIREMENTS (MANDATORY)
==================================================

The project MUST include multiple educational visualizations such as:
- Detection layer diagrams
- Bot vs human request flow
- Fingerprinting signal maps
- SOC / monitoring flow (simplified for students)
- Attack vs defense lifecycle

Visuals MUST be provided using:
- Mermaid diagrams OR
- Clear ASCII-based educational diagrams

Each visual MUST be explained in plain language.

==================================================
MANDATORY OUTPUTS (STRICT ORDER)
==================================================

1) MARKDOWN EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH REPORT
- Academic but accessible tone
- Fully explained concepts
- Answers all mandatory educational questions
- Proper citations and references
- No operational exploit details

2) VISUAL INFOGRAPHICS
- Mermaid or ASCII
- Directly tied to the explanations
- Used as learning aids, not decoration

3) COMPLETE MODERN HTML EDUCATIONAL WEBSITE (CODE ONLY)

==================================================
HTML WEBSITE REQUIREMENTS (CRITICAL)
==================================================

The HTML website MUST:
- Fully represent ALL report content
- Be clean, readable, and portfolio-ready
- Use semantic HTML
- Have NO heavy external dependencies

--------------------------------------------------
MULTI-LANGUAGE SUPPORT (MANDATORY)
--------------------------------------------------

Languages:
- Turkish (TR)
- English (EN)

Language switching MUST:
- Work on EVERY page
- Affect ALL text (titles, paragraphs, buttons, diagrams)
- Persist across navigation and reloads
- Never partially translate content

--------------------------------------------------
THEME SUPPORT
--------------------------------------------------

- Light mode
- Dark mode
- System preference
- Theme must persist across pages

--------------------------------------------------
ACCESSIBILITY & USABILITY
--------------------------------------------------

- Clear navigation
- Educational layout
- Suitable for students
- Easy to follow progression

==================================================
LEGAL & ETHICAL BOUNDARIES
==================================================

- No weaponized instructions
- No bypass scripts
- No copy-paste attack methods
- Clear discussion of ethical research boundaries
- GDPR / KVKK considerations
- Responsible security research principles

==================================================
QUALITY BAR
==================================================

- Educational clarity over complexity
- Real-world realism without operational risk
- Every technical term explained
- No unanswered "why" questions
- Suitable for cybersecurity students and instructors
